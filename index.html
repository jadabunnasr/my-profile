          <h2><strong>Spark of Inspiration</strong></h2>
                <p>Born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon, Jad Alexander is a producer and DJ currently living in Lausanne, Switzerland. His musical inspiration has deep roots, going all the way back to when he was just 3 years old dancing in front of a mirror to Michael Jackson. With quite musically oriented parents, Jad thrived on his exposure from a young age to large acts such as St. Germain, Kruder & Dorfmeister and the Thievery Corporation. His memory is engraved with long car rides as a kid when his parents would play music for extended periods of time: “I clearly remember listening for hours to St. Germain as I stared out the car’s back seat window watching the world pass by.” Jad also acquired instrumental skills such as playing the piano by the age of 14 and participating in his high school Jazz band where he alternated between tenor and alto saxophone. </p>

            <h2><strong>Taste Developement</strong></h2>
            <p>Jad's musical style developed during his teenage years, not only through his early exposure to electronic music, but also to his first hand exposure to some of the finest clubs in the world where he would find himself lost in the music. His musical taste and style moved to another level of refinement when he moved to Switzerland chilling with the right people at the right time. 
                In producing tracks, Jad's creative vision is driven by extensive experimentation with analogue equipment. From analogue synthesis to analogue effects, Jad appreciates particularly the luscious and silky sounds released, so rarely heard in today’s music.</p>
